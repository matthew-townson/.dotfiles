# my dotfiles

### What are dotfiles?  
dotfiles are files (usually with filenames that begin with a dot), that define configuration
options for software.  

These are my preferred settings, you can choose to use them, or not, or use them as a place to
start for yourself. (but they're here mostly for my convenience)
